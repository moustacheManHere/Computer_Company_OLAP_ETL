# Data Warehouse Project README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Warehouse project repository! This project was a collaborative effort by a group of classmates to create a data warehouse from various data sources. In this README, we'll provide an overview of the project, its objectives, and queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were as follows:

1. **Data Extraction**: Collect data from various sources, including CSV, TSV, Excel, SQL databases, TXT files, and JSON files.

3. **Data Loading**: Insert the extracted data into a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database using bulk insert and other relevant methods.

4. **ETL Pipeline**: Create an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to transfer data from the MSSQL database into a data warehouse.

5. **Data Warehouse**: Design and implement a data warehouse using a star schema to facilitate efficient querying and reporting.

6. **Data Analysis**: Perform queries and analysis on the data warehouse to extract valuable insights from the collected data.
Certainly, here's a concise version of the README section with the queries:

## Queries

### Query 1: Sales Staff Analysis
Provides insights into sales representatives' performance, including orders, quantities, revenue, and profits.

### Query 2: Sales Trends Over Time
Analyzes quarterly profit growth and product category trends to identify key sales patterns.

### Query 3: Quarterly Order Analysis
Offers insights into quarterly order trends, including order quantity, average products per order, and order status.

### Query 4: Customer Profit Analysis
Lists customers, their most valuable products, and total profits, highlighting top contributors.

### Query 5: Component Stock Analysis
Analyzes component stock levels, profit, and sales, categorizing them as high, medium, or low, aiding in inventory management decisions.
